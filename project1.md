 # Tech Environment Setup 
 
 ## Introduction

 This project is a demonstration of my understanding of core DevOps concepts, focusing on the initial setup
  


and configuration of essential tools within a DevOps environment. It includes step-by-step installation guides

for widely used tools such as Git, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and VirtualBox, as well as the creation of

critical developer accounts like AWS and GitHub. The process is carefully documented and supported with

links to official sources, reflecting my ability to create secure, streamlined, and practical DevOps workflows.
