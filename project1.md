 # Tech Environment Setup 
 
 ## Introduction

 This project is a demonstration of my understanding of core DevOps concepts, focusing on the initial setup
  


and configuration of essential tools within a DevOps environment. It includes step-by-step installation guides

for widely used tools such as Git, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and VirtualBox, as well as the creation of

critical developer accounts like AWS and GitHub. The process is carefully documented and supported with

links to official sources, reflecting my ability to create secure, streamlined, and practical DevOps workflows.

## Visual Studio Code (VScode)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful, lightweight, and versatile code editor developed by Microsoft,

designed for a wide range of programming languages and development tasks. Available across Windows,

macOS, and Linux, it offers features like IntelliSense for smart code completion, integrated Git support for

seamless version control, and an in-built terminal for command-line operations. Its vast extension marketplace

allows users to customize the editor with additional tools, debuggers, and themes, making it adaptable to

various development workflows. VS Code is widely praised for its speed, flexibility, and robust features,

making it a top choice among developers.
